  <br> <h2>History</h2>
  The city was created in 1938 in connection with the exploitation of the rich copper deposits. In 1973, a large mining and metallurgical complex was constructed 
  <br>to the southeast to smelt the copper that until then had been sent elsewhere for processing. Other metal ores mined and processed locally are manganese and iron. Also 
  <br> 1973, the city became the administrative center of the newly formed Dzhezkazgan Oblast, created out of Karaganda Oblast. In 1997, Dzhezkazgan (at this point Jezkazgan) 
  <br>Oblast was liquidated and the city became part of Karaganda Oblast once again. On 16 March, 2022, It was announced by Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev that Jezkazgan 
  <br>would become the administrative center of the new Ulytau Region. His decree came into force on 8 June, 2022, thus making Jezkazgan the administrative center of a Region once again.
  <br>
  <br>During the Soviet era, Jezkazgan was the site of a Gulag labor camp, Kengir, mentioned in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's book The Gulag Archipelago, and Alexander Dolgun's "An American In 
  <br>The Gulag", and the period of forced resettlement of Koreans from the Russian Far East.
